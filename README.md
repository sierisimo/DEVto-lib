# DEV.to Library

`devto-lib` is a PoC of building a library for communicating with the RESTful API from [Dev.to](https://dev.to/)

It helps me to learn things I haven't had the need to experiment, like building a library or publishing it to 
_something-maven_

It is also part of another project I'm working on currently.
